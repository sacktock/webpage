<p> <div class="italic">Charles Babbage (1791-1871) designed the first automatic computing engines. He invented computers but failed to build them. The first complete Babbage Engine was completed in London in 2002, 153 years after it was designed. Difference Engine No. 2, built faithfully to the original drawings, consists of 8,000 parts, weighs five tons, and measures 11 feet long.
This one is Serial Number 2 and is located in Silicon Valley at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.</div>
